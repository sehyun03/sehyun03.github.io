I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [POSTECH Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), where I also received my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/). 

My research interest lies in various aspects of machine learning and computer vision including, but not limited to, active learning, domain adaptation, debiasing and its applications.
I am interested in developing practical solutions to address fundamental challenges in machine learning, including data efficiency and dataset biases.
<!-- Currently, I am working on extending active learning approaches to tackle various real-world problems in computer vision. -->

I am open to research collaborations and discussions.
Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss potential opportunities.
