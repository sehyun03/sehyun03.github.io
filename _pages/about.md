I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [POSTECH Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), where I also received my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/). 

I worked on active learning, domain adaptation, and debiasing in machine learning and computer vision during my Ph.D., gaining experience in data-efficient and robust learning.
I am interested in data-centric learning and its applications to improving VLMs, LLMs, and embodied AI.

I am open to research collaborations and discussions.
Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss research-related matters.
