I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Computer Vision Lab at DGIST](https://cvlab.dgist.ac.kr/) working with Prof. [Sunghoon Im](https://sunghoonim.github.io/).
I received my Ph.D. from POSTECH, where I was advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/) in the [Computer Vision Lab at POSTECH](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/).
  
During my Ph.D., I worked on active learning, domain adaptation, and debiasing in machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on data-efficient and robust learning.
My current research interests include data-centric learning and its applications to improving vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and embodied AI control.
  
I am open to research collaborations and discussions.  
Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss research-related matters.
