I am a research scientist in the Video Recommendations Ranking Modeling team at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/).
I received my Ph.D. from POSTECH, where I was advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/) in the [Computer Vision Lab at POSTECH](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/).
  
During my Ph.D., I worked on active learning, domain adaptation, and debiasing in machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on data-efficient and robust learning.
<!-- My current research interests include data-centric learning and its applications to improving vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and embodied AI control. -->
