I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science Engineering department](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/), working as a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), advised by Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).
<!-- Previously, I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH. -->

My research lies in computer vision and deep learning including, but not limited to, multimodal learning, domain generalization, weakly supervised learning and its applications.
I am particularly interested in referring image segmentation which is an advanced semantic
segmentation task where target is not a predefined class but is described in natural language.
If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.
