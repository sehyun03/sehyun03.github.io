I am a Ph.D. student at the [POSTECH Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), under the guidance of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/), within the [Department of Computer Science Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/).

My research interest lies in various aspects of machine learning and computer vision including, but not limited to, active learning, domain adaptation, debiasing and its applications.
I recently interested in using active learning to address challenges like data shortages, spurious correlations, and data imbalances.
<!-- For detailed information on my research interests, please see [my post](https://sehyun03.github.io/blog/2023/research-interest/). -->

I'm actively seeking opportunities for meaningful collaborations and internships.
